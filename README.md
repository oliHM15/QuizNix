QuizNix
--------------
A simple quiz app that teaches basic linux commands for new users.

This program was designed for new linux users to learn simple terminal commands.
The app features a GUI with multiple choice questions about the command line and other important topics like package managment. The questions are randomized.
New questions will be added soon. 

The app is based 100% on python. To install it all you need is python:
 First check if you have python already

 Paste this command into your terminal emulator:
 ```bash
# python3 --version
```
If it returns with something like:
```bash
# Python 3.10.12
```
or similar. Then python is already installed. If it does not return with this command, you can install python from your distributions package manager, or build from source.
You will also need tkinter to run the GUI. to install on a debian based system (mint, Pop_OS!) it just run:
```bash
# sudo apt install python3-tk
```
Afterwards just run main.py
```bash
# cd Downloads
```
(or wherever you extracted the program)
```bash
# cd QuizNix-main
```
```bash
# python3 main.py
```
and do the quiz!
